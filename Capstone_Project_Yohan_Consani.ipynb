Based on the crime rate of the neighborhoods in the city of Chicago, I will develop a crime index of each neiborhood, use foursquare data to get the number and type of venues in the neighborhoods, train a model to fit the crime index to the number and type of venues in them and apply this model to predict a crime index of each neighborhood in the city my friend is moving to."

The variable of the Crimes Map that I will use will be CASE#, PRIMARY DESCRIPTION, SECONDARY DESCRIPTION and LOCATION. The case# is a itentifier of the crime, the primary and secondary descriptions show the details of the crime (for exemple: primary description: THEFT, secondary description: RETAIL THEFT), and the location show the coordinates of the crime. \n",
